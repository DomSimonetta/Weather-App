# Weather-App

## This is a weather forecast app and was built to be used as a simple forecast site, that could be used to easily and quickly find the temperature, wind speed, and Humidity for any given location. all you do is type the location into the search bar of where you want to see the weather for and the app will give you a five day forecast. Building this site as a practice for an app that uses an API helped me have a better understanding of how API's as a whole work.

## No installation steps are required to use this app 

## To use this app simply type the city of which you want to know the weather for and click search.
